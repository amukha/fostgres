## # Add some films


## ## We can't add films if we don't supply all of the required fields
## Without the field needed to insert data, Fostgres will try to perform
## `UPDATE` statements instead of `INSERT` ones. If these don't actually
## update anything then we will get a 404 back, denoting that the
## resource we're trying to update doesn't exist.
#PATCH film.slug.error / (module.path.join films.edit.csj) 404


## ## Add films normally
## With the correct fields we can create the three new films
PATCH film.slug / (module.path.join films.csj) 200 {"records": 3}
GET film.slug /iawl 200 {"title": "It's a Wonderful Life"}
PATCH film.slug /iawl {"title": "It's a Wonder Life"} 200 {"title": "It's a Wonder Life"}

# Should be able to support HEAD automatically with GET
HEAD film.slug /iawl 200

# Should fail schema check after whitespace is trimmed
PATCH film.slug /iawl {"title": "\n\n"} 422

# Should update slug iawl
PATCH film.slug "/\niawl\n" {"title": "Final"} 200 {"title": "Final"}
GET film.slug /iawl 200 {"title": "Final"}

## Error should be thrown when there is no execute key in fostgres.control.pg-error view configuration
GET film.slug.error.missing.execute /iawl 501


## ## Edit films
## Once the films are in the database, we can now edit them without needing
## all of the fields specified.
PATCH film.slug / (module.path.join films.edit.csj) 200 {"records": 3}

## Broken CSJ leads to a 400 error
PATCH film.slug / (module.path.join films.edit.broken.csj) 400
